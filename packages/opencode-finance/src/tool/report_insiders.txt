Generate a Quiver Quant insider/government-trading report with strict plan/tier gating.

Modes:
- ticker mode: provide `ticker`
- portfolio mode: omit `ticker` and use stored holdings from `portfolio`

Behavior:
- Quiver Quant auth is required
- Uses saved Quiver plan metadata for endpoint gating
- Never calls datasets above the user's tier
- Always includes a global government-trading section (congress/senate/house)
- Also generates a recent 7-day insider/government activity section such as "this week Senator X bought..."
- Writes artifacts:
  - `insiders-report.md`
  - `insiders-data.json`

Use this tool for `/report-insiders` workflows.
