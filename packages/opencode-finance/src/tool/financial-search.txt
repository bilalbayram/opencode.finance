Call this tool for finance-oriented questions when the user asks for current or historical
financial data, fundamentals, filings, insider activity, or finance news.

Use this tool in preference to web search/scraping when the request has a clear ticker
or finance intent. Keep `financial` outputs strictly tied to tool results.

Set the intent explicitly when it can be identified from user intent:
- quote: stock price, current valuation, and trading movement
- fundamentals: metrics, revenue, income, free cash flow, margins
- filings: SEC filings such as 10-Q / 10-K / 8-K
- insider: insider activity, beneficial ownership, or insider transactions
- news: financial news, press releases, and sentiment for a ticker

Use `coverage: "comprehensive"` when you need to merge multiple providers to reduce missing fields.

When this tool returns `errors`, treat missing values as uncertainty and call out that some
facts are unknown rather than inventing values.

Do not provide investment advice, forecasts, or recommendations. Treat the result as a
data retrieval primitive and distinguish factual values (`data`, `source`, `timestamp`) from
inference and interpretation.
