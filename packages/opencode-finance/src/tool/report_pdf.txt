Generate an institutional-quality PDF file from finance report artifacts in one report directory.

Use this after `/report` completes and artifacts are written.

Inputs:
- `outputRoot`: report directory containing `report.md`, `dashboard.md`, `assumptions.json`
- `filename` (optional): PDF file name to write in `outputRoot`

Behavior:
- Creates a polished, summary-first PDF:
  - page 1: premium first page with ticker snapshot, directional conviction, key drivers, and executive summary
  - remaining pages: full research content from `report.md`, `dashboard.md`, and `assumptions.json` with improved readability
- Adds `opencode.finance` footer on every page (clickable link to `https://opencode.finance`)
- Writes the PDF to disk and returns it as a file attachment
