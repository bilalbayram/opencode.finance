Generate an institutional-quality PDF file from finance artifacts in one output directory.

Inputs:
- `subcommand` (required): workflow profile (`report` or `government-trading`)
- `outputRoot`: artifact directory
- `filename` (optional): PDF file name to write in `outputRoot`

Behavior:
- `report` profile:
  - expects `/report` artifacts (`report.md`, `dashboard.md`, `assumptions.json`)
  - enforces comprehensive-report quality gates
  - uses section flow: Full Report -> Dashboard -> Assumptions
- `government-trading` profile:
  - expects government-trading artifacts (`report.md`, `dashboard.md`, `assumptions.json`, `normalized-events.json`, `delta-events.json`, `data.json`)
  - enforces government-trading-specific quality gates
  - uses section flow: Dashboard -> Full Report -> Assumptions -> Delta Events -> Normalized Events
- Creates a polished, summary-first PDF and adds `opencode.finance` footer on every page (clickable link to `https://opencode.finance`)
- Writes the PDF to disk and returns it as a file attachment
